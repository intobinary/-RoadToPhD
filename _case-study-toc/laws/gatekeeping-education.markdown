title: "Targeting Students and Gatekeeping Education"
description: "When educational malpractice becomes a strategy to 'kill' students, the law must intervene."
faq:
  "What does the term 'educational malpractice' refer to?": "'Educational malpractice' likely refers to all actions or behaviors by educational institutions that harm students' educational progress or well-being, potentially through deceptive practices or negligence. These are practices that intentionally or negligently obstruct students' access to quality education, hinder their academic progress, or endanger their well-being, potentially leading to adverse outcomes. Such as withholding critical information from students, or failing to provide promised educational services, etc."
  "What does the term 'gatekeeping education' refer to?": "'Gatekeeping education' refers to the practice of controlling or restricting access to educational opportunities through various means such as discriminatory policies, selective admissions processes, or other barriers that prevent certain groups of students from fully participating in the educational system. These are discriminatory behaviors such as biased admissions criteria, tracking systems that limit opportunities for marginalized students, inadequate support for diverse learning needs, and barriers that prevent equitable access to resources and opportunities."
  "How does gatekeeping education impact the broader societal goals of promoting economic mobility, social cohesion, and democratic participation?": "Gatekeeping education perpetuates social inequalities, limits opportunities for economic advancement, undermines social cohesion by reinforcing divisions based on race, class, or other factors, and erodes democratic principles of equal opportunity and justice within the educational system."
  "How does the law intervene in cases where educational institutions engage in deceptive practices targeting students, as suggested in the page description?": "The law may intervene by enforcing consumer protection laws and with regulatory sanctions and criminal charges against institutions responsible for deceptive practices."
  "What legal recourse do students have if they believe they have been targeted or harmed by such deceptive educational malpractice?": "Students may have legal recourse through filing complaints with relevant regulatory agencies, seeking restitution for damages or pursuing civil litigation against the institution with legal representation from advocacy groups. The interventions can contribute to safeguarding the students' rights by holding institutions accountable, preventing future deceptive practices, and ensuring transparency, fairness, and integrity in educational transactions."
  "How can educational stakeholders, including students, parents, and advocacy groups, collaborate with legal authorities to address the proliferation of educational malpractice?": "Educational stakeholders can collaborate by reporting suspected violations, providing evidence, raising awareness, participating in investigations or legal proceedings, advocating for policy reforms, supporting affected students and families, collaborating with legal advocacy organizations, and participating in community organizing efforts to address systemic barriers to educational equity.<!-- These institutions must be held accountable in providing accurate and complete information to students and prioritizing student well-being and academic success over institutional interests.-->"
