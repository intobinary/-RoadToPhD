faq:
  "What is the role of whistleblowers in the educational landscape?": "Whistleblowers play a crucial role in the educational landscape by exposing issues such as corruption, misconduct, and unethical practices, which do lead to accountability and reforms within educational institutions. By shedding light on hidden or overlooked issues within educational institutions, prompting systemic changes and fostering a culture of transparency."
  "Can the case-tudy serve as catalysts for broader systemic changes in national governance or beyond, and across various sectors of society?": "Yes, the case-tudy can serve as catalysts for broader systemic changes by inspiring reforms in governance, promoting transparency and accountability standards, and influencing policy developments that extend beyond the educational sphere. With every new painful week at Richfield, the movement grows with the sole goal of fixing systemic inequalities, advocating for marginalized communities, and promoting equitable access to education as a fundamental right. Madam Ella is setting a precedent for accountability, encouraging individuals to speak out against wrongdoing, and promoting values of honesty and fairness in all aspects of society. May it also inspire individuals to become more engaged citizens and advocates for positive change in their communities and beyond."
  "What types of issues did Madam Ella experience within this institution?": "Madam Ella has experienced a wide range of issues inside Richfield, including financial fraud, academic misconduct and frequent malpractice, discrimination, safety violations, and other forms of wrongdoing that undermine the wellbeing of the students."
