					<p class="message-text-p u-letter-details">When it was time to get to academia, my new school told me to restart despite all the documents, because they "don't know India". And SAQA refused to intervene; no effort whatsoever! <br /><br />I was so eager to get to my destination, I just agreed. <br /><br />Fast forward my 3rd year in South Africa, and I was told that I must redo my degree from the begining! AGAIN! They're trying to make the new graduation date in 2026! <br /><br />Needless to say I am not as heartwarming as I was. I have seen this pattern before! <br /><br /><br/>This is a dedicated zone for this journey of mine. Madam Ella is on a #RoadToPhD! Come and follow along, as I dodge the oppressors and get to doctorate.</p>
